These are all of the styles as of writing this. 
```json
    "styles": {
      "Recommended": ["Hebrew", "English"],
      "all-transliterated": ["Hebrew", "English", "eng-transliteration"]
    },

```
But for ones like Tehilim, I would like to make it two columns because there's a lot to read. 

So I would make it like: 
```json
    "styles": {
      "Recommended": ["Hebrew", "English"],
    },
